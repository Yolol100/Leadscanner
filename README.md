# Leadscanner

Leadscanner is being rebuilt as a fast, cold-only lead pipeline.

## Active execution path

The only active GitHub workflow is `.github/workflows/leads-cold.yml`.

Current manual run:

1. **Discovery** — resolve one region through PDOK and query Overture Maps Places; keep only candidates with a website.
2. **Cheap filters** — remove malformed/missing identity, duplicate domains within the run, and obvious competitor categories/names without visiting sites.
3. **Historical dedupe** — fetch the live Lead Dedupe Registry and exclude matches by normalized company, domain, email or prior lead ID.
4. **Verification** — for at most 100 deduped candidates, visit the official-domain website with bounded concurrency; require same-domain redirects, prove company/domain consistency, exclude confirmed competitors, and find a public business email on the official site.
5. **Bounded research** — only for verified candidates with a public business email, reuse the homepage text already fetched during verification and visit at most two additional relevant first-party pages. Store sourced visible-text evidence only; add no inferred pain or outreach copy.

The run stops after research. Offer selection, mail copy and draft creation are intentionally not implemented yet.

## Speed design

- One workflow and one execution job; no issue listeners or multi-workflow artifact chain.
- The live dedupe registry is fetched and structurally validated before discovery so a broken registry fails early.
- Website research never runs for cheap-filter or dedupe rejects.
- Verification is capped at 100 candidates with at most 10 workers.
- Research is capped at 100 verified candidates with at most 6 workers and two extra pages each.
- Homepage content is passed from verification to research, so research does not fetch it again.
- Only the cold runtime dependencies are installed and pip caching is enabled.

## Historical state

The Google Sheet **Lead Dedupe Registry** is the only retained historical lead source. It is used solely to prevent re-prospecting companies already seen in prior concepts/outreach. Historical copy, observations, scores and campaign content are not prospect research inputs.

## Safety

The active path does not generate copy, create drafts or send email. Discovery hints are not treated as verified company facts. Public business email addresses are accepted only when observed on the official site.
